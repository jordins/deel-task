Due to time constrains I have only done the core stuff requested in the exercise.
We could consider:
- Adding tests
- Adding indexes to db.
- Adding pagination to GET /jobs/unpaid and GET /contracts
- Adding swagger
- Adding proper logger like Pino, Bunyan, Winston ...
- Use helmet to improve security
- Make json responses extensible by encapsulating all returning data inside an object with data like: {data: whatever I'm returning now}
